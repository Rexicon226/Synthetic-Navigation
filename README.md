<h3>Machine Learning Autonomous Navigation 
Using Predicted and Ground-Truthed Maps</h3>

**Machine Used: for Training:**

CPU: Ryzen 9 6900hs

GPU: Nvidia RTX 3050 mobile

RAM: 32GB

**Disclaimer:**

All the images provided in this README are completely
randomly generated, including the noise.

**Explanation:**

![75fig.png](images%2F75fig.png)
The histogram is here to show the effectiveness of the model.
The model used in this example has been training
for only 500 epochs, around an hour of GPU time.
It has been trained on a mer 128 random images, and has been able to De-Noise any
randomly generated image.
