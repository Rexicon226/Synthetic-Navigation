    Calculates the number of "islands" in the given array

    Rules:
    The edges of the graph count as "walls" so that even is an island is cut off
    it is still counted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pic : list[list[1,0]]
        2 dimensional binary array of the "terrain". Typically generated with perlin noise.

    Returns
